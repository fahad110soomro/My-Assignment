Improving Comprehension of else Statements</h1><br>

Conference Name: ICPC 2020 Tool Demonstration
Date: Wed 15 Jul 2020 00:24 - 00:36 at ICPC - Session 9: For Developers Chair(s): Anderson Oliveira</h2><br>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
In large blocks of code, for the developer its got essential to make any maintenance in the large code. In particularly those that are governed by If-else statements, these large blocks of code increase the distance between the if and its else counterpart or the other dependent else statements . So this is very difficult to find the parts of If else statements means sometime there is the multiple page codes are coded by developer so there is a lot of difficulty facing by the developers to maintain the if else code means if the if is on the one page the else part may occurs on the different one so it became hard to find the if’s part. So this SimplyHover Tool is developed that helps to make maintenance easy specially for If-else statements. Its just easy to use tool and helped a lot developers its basically a plug-in make for the Eclipse IDE 
<br>
<h3>Important:</h3>
SimplyHover’s importance is to when developers hover over else statements. Its great feature to compare of if statements to its else part in large code. It appears in the main toolbar for preferences. 
<br>
<h3>Methodology:</h3>
We take an unsplitCurrent method of java from JEdit in which we have 3 else-statements occurred in large blocks of code for comprehending else blocks we used simply hover plug-in tool in Eclipse IDE that brings the if condition next to its else counterpart. simply hover presents to the developer to know hover over else the if conditions in their negated form and even lets him own simplification for that.
<br>
<h3>Motivation:</h3>
Best tool to get the else part of the if statement easily from the large code even it is occurred in the thousands of lines no matter which else part of which if statement. Now the developer can easily got that which else part is from which if statement by this amazing tool simply by hover feature.
<br>
<h3>Result:</h3>
This is the best tool for the developers to easily maintain the large code in which there is a lot of if else statements cause it helps to find the if statement’s else part easily simply by hover feature..


<h1>Automatically Granted Permissions 
in 
   Android Apps</h1>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>
Android apps are updated continuously by developers to keep up with competitors in the market. Such constant updates do not bother end users, by default the Android platform automatically pushes the most recent compatible release on the device, unless there are major changes in the list of requested permissions that users have to explicitly grant. The lack of user’s explicitly approve of update for each application may lead to some risks for the end user, as the new behavior may be the privacy invasive and then the Permission Group’s Introduction in Android make this problem worse cause If a user gives the single permission within a group the application can silently request further permissions in this group with every and each update without asking user. The threat that permission groups may pose for the privacy of Android users.
<br>
<h3>Methodology:</h3>
The empirical study on 2,865,553 app releases and showed that the in a representative app store more than 17% of apps request new dangerous permission that the operating system grants without any user’s approval. Our analysis shows that apps actually use over 56% of such automatically granted permissions, although most of that there isn’t any description given that for what purpose it is being used.
<br>
<h3>Motivation:</h3>
The motivation in this research work is that the automatically granted permissions in the android app is very harmful for the user cause it collects the personal data of the user.
<br>
<h3>Result:</h3>
Our manual inspection reveals clear abuses of apps that leak sensitive data such as user’s accurate location, list of contacts, history of phone calls, and emails which are protected by permissions that user never explicitly acknowledges.
